I guess I should put something interesting here.

As of 17/01/2019 I'm 1/3rd of the way through a computer science degree at QUT. I'm enjoying it so far. Last semester I got a 7 in Databases, and promptly used that knowledge to build a prototype budgeting app ([you can read more about that here]({% post_url 2019-01-17-paper-tracker %})).

In my spare time I make little-ish side projects, mostly web dev related. I also write and roller skate occasionally. If it's worth seeing, it's in my github repos.
